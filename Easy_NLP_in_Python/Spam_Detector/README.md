Column 1..48:
- word-frequency measure - number of times work appears divided by number of words in document * 100

Last column is a label
- 1 = spam, 0 = not spam

### Other features
- word proportion (we already saw this)
- raw word counts
- binary (1 if word appears, 0 otherwise)
- TF-IDF (takes into account the fact that some words appear in many documents, and hence don't really tell us much)
